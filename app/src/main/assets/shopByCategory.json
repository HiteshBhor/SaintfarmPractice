The ghee that’s available in mass markets is often adulterated for greater staying time and preservation. Saint Ghee is made on-location with the help of our happy cows, reared in a healthy, cluelty-free environment. Organically processed ghee has a very different flavor profile and healthy fats that can help aid you towards a healthy lifestyle while keeping the joys of your childhood alive. ",
					"product_health_benefits": "One of Ayurveda's most treasured foods, ghee has incredible healing properties.. Cow Ghee is sourced from grass-fed cows, therefore, it has a good presence of K2, butyric acid and CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid).",
